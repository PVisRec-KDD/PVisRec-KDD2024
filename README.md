### CaseStudy
We randomly select 5 user and show the visualization recommended to them in round 1, 10, 20, 50 of both C2UCB and Hier-SUCB (our method). Red box means preferred.
### Experiment
Use ``python run.py`` in PVR-full and PVR-1k directory to run the experiment.
For Plot.ly-1k the average time of runnning the simulation is about 18 minutes. In one simulation, 1000 visualizations are recommended for 100 rounds, so the estimated time for one round is about 0.01 second.
